tweets

A WordPress short code plugin to display the tweets 

Create an app in twitter and get the oauth access token, oauth access token secret, consumer key and consumer 
secret. This is the short code format.

            [mytweets atoken='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' 
                      asecret='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' 
                      ckey='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' 
                      csecret='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' 
                      handle='Twitter username']

Thats it the tweets will be displayed in a numbered format. For now I have hardcoded the number of tweets. 
Only the last 10 tweets will be returned. 

I am not a great coder. Your contributions are always appreciated. Don't forget to pull requests if you find 
something which needs improvement.
